        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>3D car modeling is crucial for applications in autonomous driving systems, 
            virtual and augmented reality, and gaming. However, due to the distinctive properties of cars, 
            such as highly reflective and transparent surface materials, existing methods often face challenges 
            in accurately reconstructing 3D models. To address these limitations, we propose Car-GS, 
            a novel approach designed to mitigate the effects of specular highlights and the coupling of 
            RGB and geometry in 3D geometric and shading reconstruction (3DGS). Our method incorporates 
            three key innovations: First, we introduce view-dependent Gaussian primitives to effectively model surface 
            reflections. Second, we identify the limitations of using a shared opacity parameter for both image rendering 
            and geometric attributes when modeling transparent objects. To overcome this, we assign a learnable geometry-specific 
            opacity to each 2D Gaussian primitive, dedicated solely to rendering depth and normals. Third, we observe that 
            reconstruction errors are most prominent when the camera view is nearly orthogonal to glass surfaces. To address this issue, we develop a quality-aware supervision module that adaptively leverages normal priors from a pre-trained large-scale normal model. Experimental results demonstrate that Car-GS achieves precise reconstruction of car surfaces and significantly outperforms prior methods.</p>
